## R-BOX

This is a simple (Ubuntu-based) box you can use as a ready-made solution to start developing with (or learning) R.

(I've created this in order to have a clean environment in which to work with R for the Coursera Data Science Specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1).

You (just) need Vagrant to create this Virtual Machine. Download Vagrant (available for all platforms), download this project and then run `vagrant up` in the directory where you downloaded it. It will probably take some time to download the image and all the dependencies.

In addition to the base Ubuntu (14.04 LTS) box, these are some things that get added:

- XFCE Lightweight GUI
- R (Version 3.X)
- RStudio
- Google Chrome Browser
