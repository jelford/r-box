## R-BOX

This is a simple (Ubuntu-based) box you can use as a ready-made solution to start developing with (or learning) R.

(I've created this in order to have a clean environment in which to work with R for the Coursera Data Science Specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1).

In addition to the base Ubuntu (14.04 LTS) box, these are some things that get added:

- XFCE Lightweight GUI
- R (Version 3.X)
- RStudio
- Google Chrome Browser
